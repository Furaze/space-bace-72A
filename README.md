Game jam with four friends. A side-scrolling platformer. Coded in Lua using the Love2D framework.
nymphofthevales: I worked mostly on the menu screens and artwork for this project.

The game can be run by bundling the folder into a .zip, changing the extension to .love, and running the given executable with Love2D.
