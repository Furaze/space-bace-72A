<p>Game jam with four friends. A side-scrolling platformer. Coded in Lua using the Love2D framework.</p>
<p>nymphofthevales: I wrote the menus and the dialog system, as well as made tile artwork for the backgrounds.</p>
<p>The game can be played by bundling the folder into a .zip, changing the extension to .love, and running the given executable with Love2D.</p>
